# Binary-Classifiers

In this, I have implemented several binary classifiers: naive Bayes, logistic regression
and a neural network.

I will be running on a physics dataset, with 8 features and
100,000 samples (called susysubset). The features are augmented to have a column of ones,
in dataloader.py (not in the data file itself). Baseline algorithms, including random predictions
and linear regression, are used to serve as sanity checks.

The algorithms outperforms random predictions, and linear regression for this binary classification dataset.
